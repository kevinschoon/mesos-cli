# Go bindings for Apache Mesos

This is a fork of [mesos-go](https://github.com/mesos/mesos-go) for use with [mesos-cli](https://github.com/vektorlab/mesos-cli) with support for the Mesos HTTP operator and other features. We hope to merge this functionality back into mesos-go as some point in the future.
